E021,Sweater time,knitlover@email.com,"Hey hi there,  Was just browsing your sweater collection and there are a couple that caught my eye. First off, that fuzzy fleece jacket (FZF0123) looks sooo cozy! What's the material like? Is it more like a sherpa fleece or more of a teddy bear fur situation?  Also loved the look of that cable knit crewneck, though I didn't see an exact name/number for it. Is that more of a heavy fisherman style knit or a lighter gauge yarn?  Let me know the deets on those two and I'll probably want to order depending on what you say! Sweater weather is the best.  Thanks!!"
E022,Shoe dilemma,"shoe.addict@email.com  ","Hi there,  I'm having a real moral dilemma here. Should I go for the metallic slingbacks (MSL1098) or the chunky sneakers (CHK8901)??? They're both so cute but so different!  On one hand, the slingbacks would be great for nights out and dressing up. But those chunky sneakers are very trendy and would be killer with jeans or casual dresses.  What do you think? If you can, maybe give me a few more details on each shoe - the materials, comfort level, etc. That might help me decide which one (or both?!) to order.  I'm just torn over here! The struggle is real. Help a shoe lover out?"
E023,Return,unhappy.customer@email.com,"I am not happy. Not happy at all.  I ordered that quilted tote bag from you guys about a week ago and it's not at all what I was expecting.

I haven't even used it yet and I already want to return it.  I don't have the order number on me, but it was the quilted tote in the burgundy color. I need to return this for a full refund ASAP. This bag is not worth what I paid for it at all.  Let me know what I need to do to get this resolved quickly. Very disappointing purchase."

She's mentioning wanting a ""trendy jacket"" for back to school, but I'm not totally sure what that means. Is it something like that shiny vinyl trench coat you have? Or maybe the faux leather moto jacket?  She's 16, so I want to get her something stylish but also appropriate. The vinyl trench almost seems a bit too edgy/mature, but the moto jacket could be cool?  What are your thoughts? Do you have any other ""trendy"" jackets for teen girls that might work? I'm a little out of the loop these days!
